# Coming-Soon-Page


While i am having fun with this github as a beginer, i forked the master repo and added some other feature to the coming-soon-page. I acttually 
replaced the background image with a background video. Also, i noticed there is no favicon in the master, so i added it in the branch. I made some minor change to the countdown and the background 
overlay opacity. This is my second active day on github, so forgive my errors if there's any....i am a beginer.

Hi people, this will actually be my first github code. I will be building a coming soon page with a count down function using html, css, and javascript. Feel free to join my github ride,  #winks
It is simply a coming soon page built with html css and javascript
